# Robot Memory Inspection System (RMIS)

This is a simple project for a **Robot Memory Inspection System**, designed to monitor:

- Memory degradation of an embodied agent
- Policy drift during long-term manipulation tasks
- Behavioral anomalies and sensor noise issues

This repository is created as a learning project and demonstration for a robot memory inspection idea.

## Features (Planned)

- Episodic / semantic / procedural memory structure
- Memory health score (MHS)
- Simple drift injection (noise, timing shift, corruption)
- Basic JSON diagnostic report
